# Why the talk?
## In short, we (will) have way more ML models and/or ML driven projects in the future

        Lesson 2: Based on your list of what you know, you might need to recheck if it's the case. If data is not available, you need to ask data owner if they can extend it? Or if it is yours, then you need to extend it.
        Also, most likely you'll need to perform data preprocessing for both training and prediction/inference
        Lesson 3: Don't underestimate this! Sometimes it takes time and before long, you are already at half of the sprint with blocked user stories
